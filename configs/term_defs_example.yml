# As fine-grained annotation requires complex categories, many successful fine-grained 
# typologies organize their classification in trees. Our interface is unique in that it can 
# render any arbitrary annotation tree, no matter its depth or breath. We will begin with 
# simple annotation setups, and then showcase some complex examples.

  ## Description
  You will be shown 10 scientific abstracts from the <DOMAIN> domain to read, 
  one abstract per Task. 
  For each abstract, you will identify complex, domain-specific concepts or jargon 
  that contribute to the difficulty of reading and understanding the passage.


  After identifying these terms, you will then give a 1-2 sentence definition of each term, as well as
  an additional simplified definition. You will also 
  rate the effort taken and understanding gained from that process.
  
  You will be paid $TODO upon **successful** completion of all Tasks 
  (each abstract must be annotated for terms, and terms must have high quality Edits).
  
  **Please use a Chromium-based web browser** (ideally Google Chrome; Brave, MS Edge acceptable) to do this study. The interface will not work on other browsers.

  ## Task Instructions

  In a new window, please take a look at this [Example Interface](https://chicagohai.github.io/thresh/?gh=kazhou/prolific_defs/main/configs/term_defs_example.yml&d=kazhou/prolific_defs/main/data/example_data.json){:target="_blank"} to see what the task will look like.

  As you proceed, save your work by clicking the `up-arrow-cloud` (Save Progress) button.
  Restore your last save by clicking the `down-arrow-cloud` (Restore Last Save) button. 
  **Refreshing this browser window will remove existing progress, so make sure to save often!**
  
  ### 1. [Annotate] Identifying terms
  Read through the provided abstract. 
  As you encounter complex terms or jargon, 
  identify them in the following steps:
  - Click the "+ Add Edit" button
  - Select the "Annotate Term" button
  - Highlight the term in the abstract. Ensure that it appears after "Selected: <term>"
  - Click "Save"

  Aim to identify 3-5 terms per abstract, though more is okay.

  ### 2. [Edit] Editing annotations
  After identifying unfamiliar terms in your initial readthrough, you will then add Edits to each term.

  Start by clicking the pencil icon next to a term annotation, and answer all questions in the Edit form.

  #### 2.1 Write a definition
  A "definition" is a statement that includes the **meaning** of the term. 
  Please write a 1-2 sentence definition for each term you identify.
  Definitions should be comprehensive as possible. 
  
  You may use Google Search to look up resources to assist you -- 
  if you do, **please open a new browser window/tab to do so**.
  Also, please keep track of roughly how long you spend searching, and do not spend more than 5 minutes searching. 
  If you cannot define the term within 5 minutes, you may leave the Edit form blank (this should not happen often).
  
  **You should NOT use LLMs to generate definitions for you.**

  An example definition for the term "antecedents" (legal) might be:
  ```
  Antecedents are the previous convictions and history of bad behavior of a defendant in a criminal case. 
  ```

  #### 2.2 Provide a simplified definition
  After writing your first definition, please rewrite the definition in simpler language, 
  as if you were defining the term to a 10-year-old. Please keep this definition to 1-2 sentences.

  An example simplified definition for the term "antecedents" (legal) might be:
  ```
  Antecedents are the bad things that a person accused of a crime has done before. 
  ```

  **Do not use Google Search or LLMs to simplify for you.**

  #### 2.3 Link sources
  If you use Google Search to help you write the definition(s) of the term, please link the sources you used in the text box.
  If you refered to multiple links, separate the links with a new line (Enter).

  #### 2.4 & 2.5 Time spent
  Estimate roughly how much time you spent (1) writing your initial definition, and (2) simplifying your definition. Report it according to the following scale:
  - 1 - very little (< 1min)
  - 2 - medium (1-2min)
  - 3 - a lot (> 3min)
  
  #### 2.6 Specifying domains
  Some terms may have definitions in multiple domains, e.g., `"transformer" (computer science)` vs. `"transformer" (electrical engineering)`.

  If you used Google Search and specified the domain to find the correct definition, select "Yes". 
  If you did not need to specify the domain, select "No".
  If you did not use Google Search, select "No". 

  #### 2.7 Understanding
  After this process, report how well you now understand the meaning of this term on the following scale:
  - 1 - not at all
  - 2 - a little
  - 3 - roughly
  - 4 - well
  - 5 - very well

  It is ok to not understand the term! Just report honestly.
  
  ### 3. [Final Comments] Final comprehension
  Once you have identified terms and defined them in their annotation frames, 
  please edit the "Final Comments" entry to answer a final question surrounding your comprehension of the abstract
  before and after defining the unfamiliar terms.
  
  If you do not see this entry, 
  please add this entry yourself by clicking "+ Add Edit" > "Comments" > Save,
  then edit the entry to answer the questions there.

  ## Submission
  After you have completed all 10 Tasks following the above instructions, 
  you can submit your annotations by clicking the `Submit` button on the last Task.
  You may close your browser window once you have submitted.
  
  **Thank you!**


  # TL;DR: 
  ```
  - Read the abstract
  - [Annotate] Identify 3-5 complex terms (save progress!)
  - For each term [Edit]:
    - Write a definition, Google Search is ok but LLMs are NOT OK (no ChatGPT!)
    - Write a simplified definition by yourself (no Google or LLMs now!)
    - Cite sources
    - Report time spent
    - Save progress often!
  - [Final Comments] Answer final comprehension question (and save progress again!)
  ```
