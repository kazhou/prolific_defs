These inactive prodrugs undergo extensive metabolism to form active cytotoxic metabolites, which act mainly by incorporating into DNA and affecting cell replication. Thiopurine methyltransferase is a highly variable cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the S-methylation of the thiopurine bases-an inactivating pathway. Patients with low-activity variants of TPMT can be affected by pronounced pharmacologic effects when receiving thiopurine medications. Clinical studies have reported significant interpatient variability in intracellular thiopurine metabolite concentrations in patients receiving thiopurine therapy. In this chapter, we present an LC-MS/MS method to monitor the thiopurine metabolites: 6-thioguanine nucleotides and 6-methylmercaptopurine derivatives in human erythrocytes. This method utilizes acid hydrolysis to release the bases and improves upon previously published procedures by utilizing stable isotope internal standards and a more efficient chromatographic separation.", "target": "", "edits": [{"category": "overall_comments", "id": 1, "annotation": null}], "_id": "pm_25974"}, {"context": "Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to Study Plant Peptide Ligand-Receptor Interactions.", "source": "The field of plant receptor biology has rapidly expanded in the past three decades.

A glucose trend prediction model with high accuracy in real-time can greatly improve the glycemic control effect of the artificial pancreas and effectively prevent the occurrence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. In this paper, we propose an improved wavelet transform threshold denoising algorithm for the non-linearity and non-smoothness of the original CGM data. By quantitatively comparing the mean square error (MSE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) before and after the improvement, we prove that the improved wavelet transform threshold denoising algorithm can reduce the degree of distortion after the smoothing of CGM data and improve the extraction effect of CGM data features at the same time. Based on this finding, we propose a glucose trend prediction model (IWT-GRU) based on the improved wavelet transform threshold denoising algorithm and gated recurrent unit. We compared the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination ($ {\\mathrm{R}}^{2} $) of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support vector regression (SVR), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and IWT-GRU on the original CGM monitoring data of 80 patients for 7 consecutive days with different prediction horizon (PH).

Pesticides are well recognized risk factors for PD, supported by both epidemiological and experimental evidence, with multiple detrimental effects beyond dopaminergic neuron damage alone. The microbiome-gut-brain axis has gained much attention in recent years and is considered to be a significant contributor and driver of PD pathogenesis. In this narrative review, we first focus on how both pesticides and the microbiome may influence PD initiation and progression independently, describing pesticide-related central and peripheral neurotoxicity and microbiome-related local and systemic effects due to dysbiosis and microbial metabolites. We then depict the bidirectional interplay between pesticides and the microbiome in the context of PD, synthesizing current knowledge about pesticide-induced dysbiosis, microbiome-mediated alterations in pesticide availability, metabolism and toxicity, and complex systemic pesticide-microbiome-host interactions related to inflammatory and metabolic pathways, insulin resistance and other mechanisms. An overview of the unknowns follows, and the role of pesticide-microbiome interactions in the proposed body-/brain-first phenotypes of PD, the complexity of environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions is discussed.

However, most previously reported mercury compounds are susceptible to reduction, leading to the release of elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>) and causing secondary pollution. In this study, we unveil a groundbreaking discovery that underscores the vital role of halogenation in creating exceptionally stable Hg<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> compounds. Through the dynamic interplay of Hg, Se, and halogens, an intermediary stage denoted [HgSe]<sub><i>m</i></sub>[HgX<sub>2</sub>]<sub><i>n</i></sub> emerges, and this transformative process significantly elevates the stabilization of mercury. Remarkably, halogen ions strategically occupy pores at the periphery of HgSe clusters, engendering a more densely packed atomic arrangement of Hg, Se, and halogen components. A marked enhancement in both thermal and acid stability is observed, wherein temperatures ascend from 130 to 300 &#176;C (transitioning from HgSe to Hg<sub>3</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>).
