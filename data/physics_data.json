These formulae are applicable to observed data which is usually a sum of the true signal and one or more secondary fields that can be either noise, or some residual contaminating signal.

In this work, we use infrared and optical colors in order to build an all-inclusive galactic activity diagnostic tool that can discriminate between star-forming, AGN, LINER, composite, and passive galaxies, and which can be used in local and low-redshift galaxies. We explore classification criteria based on infrared colors from the 3 WISE bands supplemented with optical colors from the u, g, and r SDSS bands. From these we aim to find the minimal combination of colors for optimal results. Furthermore, to mitigate biases related to aperture effects, we introduce a new WISE photometric scheme combing different sized apertures. We develop a diagnostic tool using machine learning methods that includes both active and passive galaxies under one unified scheme using 3 colors. We find that the combination of W1-W2, W2-W3, and g-r colors offers good performance while the broad availability of these colors for a large number of galaxies ensures wide applicability on large galaxy samples.

The effect of wake interference on the inverted foil's coupled dynamics is systematically examined at a fixed $Re$ as a function of non-dimensional bending rigidity ($K_{B}$) and the structure to fluid mass ratio ($m^{*}$). Our results show that the inverted foil experiences a relatively higher transverse fluid loading under unsteady wake flow. Consequently, flapping instability is induced at a higher $K_{B}$ value as compared to an isolated foil. There exists a critical $K_{B, Cr} = 0.25$, above which the downstream foil is synchronized with the unsteady wake, and the cylinder controls the flapping response and the wake vortex dynamics. During synchronization, two additional flapping modes are observed as a function of decreasing $K_{B}$, namely small amplitude flapping and moderate amplitude flapping modes. Below $K_{B, Cr}$, the downstream foil undergoes self-induced large-amplitude flapping similar to an isolated foil counterpart. Interestingly, unlike an isolated inverted foil, in the tandem setup, the flapping dynamics are strongly influenced by both $K_{B}$ and $m^{*}.$ The findings from this study aim to generalize our understanding of the self-induced flapping dynamics of inverted foils and have relevance to the development of inverted foil-based renewable energy harvesters.", "target": "", "edits": [], "_id": 2311.09339}, {"context": "Composition dependence of electronic defects in CuGaS2", "source": "CuGaS2 films grown by physical vapour deposition have been studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, using excitation intensity and temperature dependent analyses.

The presence of cylinders of arbitrary nature causes abrupt changes in the local flow profile while globally exhibiting a wide spectrum of dynamical wakes fluctuating in either a periodic or chaotic manner. Consequently, the focal point of the present study is to establish predictive frameworks that accurately reconstruct the overall fluid velocity flowfield such that the local boundary layer profile, as well as the wake dynamics, are both preserved for long time horizons. The hybrid framework is realized using a base differentiable flow solver combined with a neural network, yielding a differentiable physics-assisted neural network (DPNN). The framework is trained using bodies with arbitrary shapes, and then it is tested and further assessed on out-of-distribution samples. Our results indicate that the neural network acts as a forcing function to correct the local boundary layer profile while also remarkably improving the dissipative nature of the flowfields. It is found that the DPNN framework clearly outperforms the supervised learning approach while respecting the reduced feature space dynamics. The model predictions for arbitrary bodies indicate that the Strouhal number distribution with respect to spacing ratio exhibits similar patterns with existing literature.
